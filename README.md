# Reflection
Creating a portfolio in GitHub was both an exciting and challenging experience. One of the first challenges I faced was learning how to properly set up repositories and organize files in a way that would make the portfolio clear and professional. At first, I struggled with understanding the basics of Git commands such as cloning, committing, and pushing updates. To solve this, I referred to online tutorials, GitHubâ€™s documentation, and practiced by making small changes until I became more confident with the workflow. Another challenge was designing the portfolio itself, as I wanted it to look simple but still highlight my projects effectively. I overcame this by exploring existing portfolio templates on GitHub Pages, customizing them, and gradually building my own style.

Another difficulty was connecting my portfolio to GitHub Pages so it could be viewed online. Initially, I encountered issues with broken links and missing files, but I solved them by carefully checking the folder structure and testing the site step by step.

Looking ahead, I would improve my portfolio by making it more interactive and visually appealing. For example, I plan to add a personal logo, improve navigation, and include detailed project descriptions with screenshots or live demos. I also want to update the portfolio regularly with new projects, ensuring that it reflects my current skills and growth. This will make my GitHub portfolio not only a showcase of work but also a tool for continuous learning and career development.
